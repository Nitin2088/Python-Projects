Dear [HR Manager],

I am writing to inform you of my resignation from my current position at [Company Name]. This was not an easy decision to make, as I have enjoyed my time here and have grown both personally and professionally.

Unfortunately, after much consideration and personal reflection, I have come to the realization that it is time for me to move on to new challenges and opportunities. As much as I have appreciated my time at [Company Name], I believe this change is necessary for my personal and career growth.

I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the support and guidance that you and the entire HR team have provided me during my time here. Your mentorship and encouragement have been invaluable to me and have played a significant role in my development as a professional.

I have learned so much during my tenure at [Company Name], and I will always be grateful for the opportunities that were given to me. I have been fortunate to work with such a talented and dedicated team, and I will miss the camaraderie and collaborative work environment.

Please know that I will do everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition during my remaining time at the company. I am happy to assist in finding and training my replacement and completing any outstanding projects before my last day
